# Convert string to camel case

Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized **only** if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case). The next words should be always capitalized.

## Examples

`"the-stealth-warrior"` gets converted to `"theStealthWarrior"`

`"The_Stealth_Warrior"` gets converted to `"TheStealthWarrior"`

`"The_Stealth-Warrior"` gets converted to `"TheStealthWarrior"`

### Given Code

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    return
```

### Sample Tests

```python
import codewars_test as test
from solution import to_camel_case


@test.describe("Sample Tests")
def sample_tests():
    @test.it("Tests")
    def _():
        test.assert_equals(to_camel_case(""), "", "An empty string was provided but not returned")
        test.assert_equals(to_camel_case("the_stealth_warrior"), "theStealthWarrior", "to_camel_case('the_stealth_warrior') did not return correct value")
        test.assert_equals(to_camel_case("The-Stealth-Warrior"), "TheStealthWarrior", "to_camel_case('The-Stealth-Warrior') did not return correct value")
        test.assert_equals(to_camel_case("A-B-C"), "ABC", "to_camel_case('A-B-C') did not return correct value")
```
