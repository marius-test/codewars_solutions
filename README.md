# codewars_solutions

This repository contains my solutions to Codewars challenges.

### Structure

- Each problem has its own folder named after the challenge.
- Inside each folder:
  - A `.md` file with the problem description.
  - A `.py` file containing my solution.

### Purpose

To practice and improve my coding skills through solving a variety of algorithmic and programming challenges.

My Codewars profile: [marius-test](https://www.codewars.com/users/marius-test)

### Notes

For some of the challenges, multiple solutions are available. This reflects my learning process:

- **Version 1** is typically my first attempt, focusing on a direct and clear programming.
- **Later versions** (v2, v3) are my attempts at refactoring the code to be more concise and ***pythonic***, often with the help of tutorials.

Some solutions are heavily commented. I use these comments as a personal learning tool to document key concepts for future reference.
